# k-means_clustering
K-means clustering model to create segmentation.

#### Created by: Ristanti Ramadanti

A template i created to help my (future) self building clustering model not from scratch.
Clustering is an unsupervised learning to classify our observations into certain number (k) of clusters.
Examples of implementation are for customer segmentations, sports player profiling, etc.

### Machine learning algorithm:
Clustering model with the following algorithms:
    - K-means Clustering

### Data analytics process include:

   - Preprocessing of data: merging, cleaning, transforming (scaling), feature engineering, variable selection
   - Choosing optimal k (for k-means clustering) using the following technique:
       - Silhouette analysis
       - Elbow method
   - Applying clustering analysis
   - Visualizing clusters
